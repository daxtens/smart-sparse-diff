[sparse][0] is a useful tool for static analysis of the Linux kernel.

However, it tends to generate a lot of output. A run on a reasonably
small powerpc defconfig gives over 3000 lines of output. This - and
the fact that running with ~make -jNN~ will give you output in
unpredictable order - makes running a ~diff~ over the results quite
tricky. Furthermore, a code change that moves code around will
lead to sparse warnings changing line numbers, meaning ~diff~ will
double-count them.

This python script aims to make that a bit easier.

Designed specifically with sparse in mind, this script:

 - eliminates exact matches

 - eliminates warnings that are the same except for a change in line
   number

 - comfortably deals with warnings that are split across multiple lines

   For example:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_scsi.c:5606:30: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_scsi.c:5606:30:    expected int [signed] memory_flags
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_scsi.c:5606:30:    got restricted gfp_t
   #+END_EXAMPLE

 - prints the output in the unified diff format we all know and love
